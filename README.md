# SIFT_Neural_Net

Explore the use of SIFT descriptors in place of pooling layers in traditional CNN architectures. Explore the idea that max-pooling layers discard translational and rotational relationships between low-level features while SIFT descriptors capture the spatial relationship and orientation between these features. 

Based on  “Exploiting SIFT Descriptor for Rotation Invariant Convolutional Neural Network” by Kumar et. al, https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1904/1904.00197.pdf
